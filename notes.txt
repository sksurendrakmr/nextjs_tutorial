React Server Components (RSC)
--
React server components is a new architecture introduced by the React team in version
18 which was quickly embraced by Next.js

The architecture introduces a new way of creating React components, splitting them into 
two types:
 - Server components
 - Client components


 Server components
 ---
 - In Next.js, all components are server components by default.
 - They have the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database.
 - However, they don't have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions.

 Client components
 ---

 - To create a client component, it's necessary to add "use client" at the top of the component file
 - Client components can't perform tasks like reading files, but they have the ability to use hooks and manage interactions.



 Routing
 ---
 Next.js has a file system based routing mechanism.

 URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in our codebase.

 Next.js is a file based routing mechanism but does that mean every file in our app corresponds to a route?? --> NO

 Routing conventions
 ---
 All routes must be placed inside the app folder.
 Every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.js or page.tsx.
 Each folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL.
