React Server Components (RSC)
--
React server components is a new architecture introduced by the React team in version
18 which was quickly embraced by Next.js

The architecture introduces a new way of creating React components, splitting them into 
two types:
 - Server components
 - Client components


 Server components
 ---
 - In Next.js, all components are server components by default.
 - They have the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database.
 - However, they don't have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions.

 Client components
 ---

 - To create a client component, it's necessary to add "use client" at the top of the component file
 - Client components can't perform tasks like reading files, but they have the ability to use hooks and manage interactions.



 Routing
 ---
 Next.js has a file system based routing mechanism.

 URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in our codebase.

 Next.js is a file based routing mechanism but does that mean every file in our app corresponds to a route?? --> NO

 Routing conventions
 ---
 All routes must be placed inside the app folder.
 Every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.js or page.tsx.
 Each folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL.

Notes: Route is associated with file based on the containing folders name within the 
app folder.

By creating a nested folder structure, files will automatically be routed in the same
way within the URL.

Private folders
---
A private folder indicates that it is a private implementation detail and should not be
considered by the routing system

The folder and all its subfolders are excluded from routing.

Prefix the folder name with an underscore.

Use for 
- For separting UI logic from routing logic 
- For consistently organizing internal files across a project.
- For sorting and grouping files in code editor.
- For avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions.

If we want to include an underscore in URL segments, we can prefix the folder name "%5F", which is the URL-encoded form of an underscore.
